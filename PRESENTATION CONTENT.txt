Hello, my fellow boys and girls! I hope you are all doing well. Today, we will give our first presentation of English on the topic: 'Why to Become a Programmer.' We will present it in a group, and the group includes me and my partner, Talha

So here I will start by discussing some points that why to become a programmer 

Why to become a programmer:
High Demand and Job Security ( Programmers are in high demand now a days across industries so through programming you can get great job opportunities )
Problem-Solving and Creativity ( Programming helps you to solve complex problems that will increase your problem solving skills and creativity ) 
Building Real-World Solutions ( Through programming you can create real world applications that solve real-world problems )

Next, I’ll hand it over to my Talha Khurram, who will explain why we selected this topic and will provide some reasons of it 

Thank you !, Firstly let me explain that why I choosed this topic because  I’m a programmer myself with about 2 year of working experience and I believe there are many good reasons to learn programming one of the most important reason is for the opportunity to make money .In today’s world, many people are making money for themselves there families for there childrens through programming Also if you don't know the world richest person Bilgades started doing programming when he was 13 years of age also the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg started programming when he was in 6th class so this is one of the most major reason why you should learn programming also there are many other reasons like programming improves your problem solving skills and decision making which can help you in real life when you get stucked in some problem


Now, I’ll hand it over to my partner, who will present the opinion paragraph on the topic that we wrote together

Here’s the opinion paragraph that we wrote together

So, here I have used an opinion paragraph to describe my topic. In the topic sentence, I agree with the idea that learning programming is valuable, as seen in the statement: 'I strongly believe that learning programming is a valuable skill.' Similarly, in the concluding sentence, I again agree with the topic: 'Programming is an essential skill that can lead to both personal and professional growth.' Throughout the paragraph, I’ve used transitions like 'Firstly,' 'In addition,' 'Moreover,' and 'Therefore' between the supporting sentences to make the flow of ideas more better 

I strongly believe that learning programming is a valuable skill. **Firstly**, programming opens up many job opportunities, allowing people to earn money and support their families. **In addition**, it helps improve problem-solving skills, which are useful in many areas of life. **Moreover**, programming gives you the chance to create new ideas and bring them to life through coding **Therefore**, learning programming not only opens up job opportunities but also gives you the  power to turn your ideas into reality. **In conclusion**, programming is an essential skill that can lead to both personal and professional growth.

Now that we’ve explored the reasons why programming is so important, I’ll hand it over to Talha, who will provide some suggestions for it. Over to you, Talha!

"For computer science students like yourselves, programming is especially valuable as it forms the backbone of your field and opens doors to exciting opportunities in technology."

"Learning programming will not only enhance your problem-solving skills but also prepare you for high-demand roles in industries like AI, web development, and app creation."

"As future computer scientists, mastering programming will help you bring innovative ideas to life and solve real-world challenges effectively." 

Personally, I would suggest all of you to learn programming because, as computer science students, it will greatly benefit your future. From my own experience, programming has helped me build valuable skills and even earn through freelancing. Beyond that, it opens up countless job opportunities in various industries and allows you to create innovative solutions while enhancing your problem-solving and creativity.

So these were my suggestions on this topic. Now, let's move on to the conclusion of our presentation

"Personally, I learned many things through this presentation, such as how to work in a team, present in front of public, and creating slides. It was a great experience working with Alman, who fully participated in the entire process also I choose the topic but he didn’t maked a single argument The most important thing I liked about working on this presentation was discussing the importance of programming, as I love talking about it, especially for computer science students.

To be honest, the most challenging part was practicing for the presentation. We stayed after university to practice, and it was difficult finding an empty classroom. Additionally, making the slides was a challenging part too. But after all, it’s all part of the process. This was our presentation, and I hope you all liked it. Thank you!"
